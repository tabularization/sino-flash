# Sino Flash

Sino Flash is a simple flashcard application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows you to learn most commonly used Mandarin words and their English translations through interactive flashcards. 🀄📚

## Requirements
    Python 3.x
    Tkinter library
    Pandas library

## Usage
1. Install Required Libraries 🛠️
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed by running the following command:

2. Run the Flashcard Application 🚀
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the Python file is located, and run the following command:

3. Start Learning Mandarin! 🏮🌟
The flashcard application window will appear, displaying a randomly selected Mandarin word.
Click on the flashcard to flip it and reveal the English translation.
If you guessed correctly, click the ✅ button. The word will be marked as learned, and a new flashcard will appear.
If you need more practice or guessed incorrectly, click the ❌ button. The flashcard will be replaced with a new one.
The application automatically saves your progress, so you won't see the same word again if you clicked ✅.

That's it! Enjoy learning Mandarin with the FlashcardApp. 🀄📚
